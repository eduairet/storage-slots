# Storage Slots in Practice

This document has a practical approach to storage slots in solidity.

## Content

1. Contracts:
    - [Storage01.sol](./contracts/Storage01.sol)
    - [Storage02.sol](./contracts/Storage02.sol)
2. Libraries
    - [StorageSlot.sol](./contracts/StorageSlot.sol)
        - [`OpenZeppelin` library](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol) to easily allocate storage without dealing with `assembly`

## Check storage

1. Run a new node `npx hardhat node`
    - [`hardhat.config.ts`](./hardhat.config.ts) is already set to run all the commands within a local hardhat node, check the `defaultNetwork` key
2. Deploy the contracts `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts`
    - This will generate an `.env` file with the addresses you need to check the storage slots on every contract
3. Now you can test both contracts and check how the storage works
    - [Storage01](./scripts/lookup-storage-01.ts) -> `npx hardhat run scripts/lookup-storage-01.ts`
    - [Storage02](./scripts/lookup-storage-02.ts) -> `npx hardhat run scripts/lookup-storage-02.ts`
    - If you check the value printed in the console on every script is the same value that we have in our contracts, weâ€™re accessing that value through the storage slot with the `ethers.provider.getStorageAt` method
